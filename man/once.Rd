\usage{
once(expr, file_path = NULL, rerun = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{The expensive expression to evaluate}

\item{file_path}{File path for saving the output object as an Rds file. Defaults to an auto-generated file in the 'saved_objects' folder in current project's directory. Note that if no filename is provided it will rerun and re-save every time!}

\item{rerun}{Rerun the expression anyway and save the result? Defaults to false.}
}
\value{
the results of expr
}
\description{
The \code{once()} function allows you to easily execute expensive compute operations only once, and save the resulting object to disk.
}
\examples{
save_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".Rds")
 # temporary file path - replace with your preferred saved file path
my_out <-
  runif(1e8) \%>\% # some expensive operation
  mean() \%>\%
  once(file_path = save_file)
  # only do it once, save output to this file.
}
